cake-forms.css
==============

A plugin for CakePHP 2.x which provides base CSS styles for forms created using the FormHelper. Automatically makes your CakePHP forms responsive.

The code has been written using LESS and can be totally customised to your requirements by altering the variables at the top of the cake-forms.less file and recompiling.

Styles have been created for:
- Forms of different widths (you can apply classes like cake-form-width-75 for 75% for example)
- Inline forms (for example login forms)
- 'Horizontal' forms with the label to the left of the form elements
